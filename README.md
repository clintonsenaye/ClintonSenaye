<h1>Cybersecurity Projects:</h1>

<h2>Foundations of Cybersecurity</h2>

Throughout this course, I acquired knowledge regarding the fundamental job duties and essential skills required for professionals working in the cybersecurity industry. I looked at the eight security areas of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), as well as different security frameworks and controls and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. I have been acquainted with the standard tools utilized by security analysts to safeguard both individuals and organizations. Finally, I had the opportunity to learn how  to compose a professional statement.

<h2>Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks</h2>

During the course, I acquired an enhanced comprehension of the eight security domains of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), along with distinct security frameworks and controls. I received an introduction to utilizing security tools and conducting audits as a means of safeguarding assets and data. These concepts are widely recognized as fundamental in the cybersecurity industry, and comprehending them is crucial for safeguarding organizations and their stakeholders against potential threats, hazards, and susceptibilities. At the end of the course I got the opportunity to conduct an internal audit for a fictional company; Biotium toys. In this activity I analyzed the organizations audit scope, goals and risk assessment.In conducting the audit: control assessment, I reviewed the list of Botium Toysâ€™ assets, reviewed each control name, reviewed the control types and explanation, marked an "X" next to each control that needs to be implemented and noted the levels of priority (high, medium, and/or low; NA if not applicable)

As part of the internal audit process, I have conducted a compliance checklist. In light of the hypothetical company's situation, I took into account the geographical locations where the company operates and the methods by which they receive payments from their clientele. In addition, I provided an explanation as to why it is imperative for the company to comply with the chosen regulations and standards.

<h4>Project description:</h4>

During this project, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of Botium Toys' cybersecurity programme. The audit aimed to ensure that current business practices are in line with industry standards and best practices.

<h2>Connect and Protect: Network and Network Security</h2>

During this course I gained knowledge in networks, network architecture, and security practices used to protect networks from potential security breaches. I began by examining network architecture, understanding the design to identify vulnerable components requiring security measures. My knowledge extended to network operations and their influence on data communication, where network protocols regulate data transmission. I learned about threats from malicious actors, such as denial of service attacks, packet sniffing, and IP spoofing, and I implemented security measures including firewall rules. I also learned about security hardening to reduce the attack surface of a network, implementing measures at different levels like hardware, software, and network. Finally I learned that securing networks is vital for a security analyst's role, requiring a comprehensive grasp of network infrastructure, operations, and security protocols to succeed.

In an activity, I used the knowledge gained about networks to analyze a network incident.I  analyzed the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and created an incident report.

<h4>Project description</h4>

As a cybersecurity analyst in a multimedia company offering various services to small businesses, a recent DDoS attack disrupted network services for two hours. The attack flooded the network with ICMP packets, rendering internal network traffic inaccessible. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, halting non-critical services, and restoring critical ones. A subsequent investigation revealed that a malicious actor exploited an unconfigured firewall, executing a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
To address the breach, the network security team instituted several measures:

1. Implementing a new firewall rule to limit incoming ICMP packets' rate.
2. Introducing source IP address verification on the firewall to detect spoofed IP addresses.
3. Employing network monitoring software to detect unusual traffic patterns.
4. Utilizing an IDS/IPS system to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious traits.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you're tasked with crafting a plan for enhancing network security, guided by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This framework assists you in dissecting the incident, and you'll incorporate the analysis into a comprehensive security strategy.

<h2>Tools of the trade: Linux and SQL </h2>

In the course, I acquired foundational knowledge encompassing operating systems, Linux communication through commands, and Structured Query Language (SQL) for database querying. The curriculum introduced Linux's role in cybersecurity, delving into its architecture and prevalent distributions. Proficiency in the Linux shell was emphasized as a means of interacting with the system. My focus included understanding Linux's security application, architecture, common distributions, shell-based interaction, and navigating and managing the file system through Bash commands. Authentication, authorization, and file permissions management were central themes.

Moreover, the course equipped me with SQL proficiency for effective database communication. I gained expertise in querying databases, filtering results, and utilizing SQL to combine tables. Emphasis was on SQL's security applications, relational database structure, query formulation, filtering, and utilizing joins for table combination. This comprehensive curriculum significantly enhanced my expertise as a cybersecurity analyst.

<h4>Project Description:</h4>

The research team at our organisation is required to update the file permissions for specific files and directories within the `projects` directory. The current permissions do not align with the appropriate level of authorization that should be granted. Verifying and updating these permissions will contribute to maintaining the security of their system. To successfully accomplish this task, I executed the following actions:

Check file and directory details:

The provided code exemplifies the utilisation of Linux commands to ascertain the current permissions assigned to a particular directory within the file system.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/9883ccdc-a9af-4fa5-a82b-5c0f9558576f)

The screenshot depicts the command inputted in the first line, while the subsequent lines exhibit the corresponding output. The provided code retrieves and displays the complete list of contents within the projects directory. I utilised the `ls` command with the `-la` option to generate a comprehensive listing of the file contents, including hidden files. The command output reveals the presence of a single directory named `"draughts,"` a hidden file named `".project_x.txt"` and a total of five additional project files. The 10-character string displayed in the first column denotes the permissions assigned to each file or directory.

Describe the permissions string

The 10-character string can be analysed to ascertain the authorised individuals who have access to the file and the precise permissions granted to them. The following is a list of the characters and their corresponding representations:

- The 1st character: The character in question serves as a file type indicator and can be either a lowercase letter `"d"` or a hyphen `(-)`. If the letter is `"d,"` it indicates that it represents a directory. If the character is a hyphen `(-)`, it indicates that the file is a regular file.

- The 2nd to 4th characters in the file permissions indicate the user's read `(r)`, write `(w)`, and execute `(x)` permissions. If one of the characters in question is a hyphen `(-)`, it signifies that the user does not have permission for that particular action.

- The characters in the 5th-7th positions represent the permissions assigned to the group, specifically the read `(r)`, write `(w)`, and execute `(x)` permissions. If one of the characters in question is a hyphen `(-)`, it signifies that the permission in question is not granted for the group.

- The characters in positions 8 to 10 represent the permissions for other users, specifically the read `(r)`, write `(w)`, and execute `(x)` permissions. This owner type encompasses all users on the system, excluding the user and the group. If one of the characters in question is a hyphen `(-)`, it signifies that this permission is not granted for others.

An instance of file permissions can be observed in `project_t.txt`, where the permissions are denoted as `-rw-rw-r--`. The presence of a hyphen `(-)` as the first character in the file name `project_t.txt` signifies that it is a file rather than a directory. The presence of the character `'r'` in the second, fifth, and eighth positions denotes that the permissions for `user`, `group`, and `other` allow for read access. The third and sixth characters in the permission string correspond to the write permissions for the user and group, respectively. The `project_t.txt` file does not have any users with execute permissions.

Change file permissions

The organisation has made the decision to restrict write access to their files from others. In order to adhere to the requirements, I consulted the file permissions that I had previously provided. Based on my assessment, it is necessary to revoke the write access for other users on `project_k.txt`.

The subsequent code exemplifies the utilisation of Linux commands to accomplish this task.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/029d96df-08af-424a-9338-1d77171bc6f7)

The screenshot depicts the input commands in the initial two lines, while the subsequent lines showcase the output generated by the second command. The `"chmod"` command is used to modify the permissions of files and directories. The initial parameter specifies the desired permissions to be modified, while the subsequent parameter designates the specific file or directory. In this example, the write permissions for the `"project_k.txt"` file were revoked from the `"other"` user. Subsequently, I utilised the command `"ls -la"` to assess the modifications I had implemented.

Chnage file permission on a hidden file

The research team at our organisation has recently archived `project_x.txt`. The project administrators have specified that write access should not be granted to any individuals. However, read access is to be provided to both the user and the group. 

The code provided below illustrates the utilisation of Linux commands to modify permissions:

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/a9b4845b-c124-435d-94cb-837b03402f5a)

The screenshot depicts the input commands entered in the first two lines, while the subsequent lines exhibit the output generated by the second command. I am aware.The file named `"project_x.txt"` is considered hidden due to its file name convention, as it begins with a period `(.)`. In this particular instance, I have revoked the write permissions from both the user and the group, while simultaneously granting read permissions to the group. I have revoked the write permissions from the user by utilising the u-w command. I proceeded to revoke the write permissions from the group using the command `g-w`, and subsequently granted read permissions to the group using the command `g+r`. 

Change directory permissons

Our organization's access permissions dictate that only the user `researcher2` should be granted access to the draughts directory and its associated contents. This implies that only `researcher2` should possess the authority to execute permissions.

The code provided below showcases the utilisation of Linux commands to modify permissions:

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/84252159-a933-441b-95f8-9ffeb404eacb)

The screenshot depicts the commands I inputted in the first two lines, while the subsequent lines showcase the output of the second command. Based on my earlier findings, it was determined that the group possessed execute permissions. Consequently, the chmod command was employed to eliminate said permissions. The user `researcher2` already possessed the necessary execute permissions, thus there was no requirement to include them.

Summary: I have modified various permissions in order to align the level of authorization with the desired standards set by my organisation for files and directories within the projects directory. To begin, the initial step involved utilising the command `"ls -la"` to examine the permissions assigned to the directory. This information influenced my decision-making process in the subsequent stages. I proceeded to utilise the chmod command on multiple occasions in order to modify the permissions of both files and directories.

<h3>Applying Filters to SQL queries</h3>

The provided code exemplifies the implementation of a SQL query designed to filter login attempts that have taken place outside the geographical location of Mexico. 

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/035bde15-7e99-4f4e-b2c8-a855a5f3d4ea)

The initial section of the screenshot displays the query I have executed, while the subsequent section showcases a partial excerpt of the resulting output. This query retrieves all login attempts that have taken place in countries other than Mexico. To begin, I initiated the process by executing a query to retrieve all data from the `log_in_attempts` table. Subsequently, a `WHERE` clause was employed, utilising the `NOT` operator to selectively filter out countries excluding Mexico. I utilised the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `MEX%` to perform the matching operation, as the dataset contains representations of Mexico as both `MEX` and `MEXICO`. When the percentage sign `(%)` is used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator, it serves as a wildcard character that can represent any number of unspecified characters. 

Retrieve employees in Marketing

I utilised the LIKE operator with the pattern MEX% to perform the matching operation, as the dataset contains representations of Mexico as both MEX and MEXICO. When the percentage sign (%) is used in conjunction with the LIKE operator, it serves as a wildcard character that can represent any number of unspecified characters. 

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/4931d881-f904-4149-bdfe-e92f098412d6)

The initial section of the screenshot displays the query I executed, while the subsequent section showcases a partial excerpt of the resulting output. This query retrieves a list of all employees who are currently assigned to the Marketing department located in the East building. Initially, I began by retrieving all the data from the `employees` table. Subsequently, a `WHERE` clause was employed, utilising the logical operator `AND`, to effectively filter employees based on their affiliation with the Marketing department and their location within the East building. I utilised the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `"East%"` to perform a matching operation. This was done in order to identify data in the `office` column that corresponds to the East building, along with its specific office number. The initial criterion involves the `department = 'Marketing'` segment, which serves to narrow down the selection to employees belonging to the Marketing department. The second condition pertains to the `office` field, specifically using the `LIKE` operator with the `'East%'` pattern. This condition serves to filter employees who are located in the East building.

Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

The machines utilised by employees in the Finance and Sales departments are also in need of updating. Due to the requirement for an alternative security update, it is necessary to obtain employee information exclusively from the following two departments.

The provided code showcases the implementation of a SQL query designed to filter employee machines based on their department affiliation, specifically targeting employees in the Finance or Sales departments.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/9772dd69-9ae4-402a-9be6-3ae5626c1ea3)

The initial section of the screenshot displays the query I have executed, while the subsequent section showcases a partial excerpt of the resulting output. This query retrieves a list of all employees who are currently assigned to the Finance and Sales departments. Initially, I began by retrieving all data from the `employees` table.

<h2>Automate Cybersecurity Tasks With Python</h2>

In my comprehensive training, I gained proficiency in Python programming, emphasizing its applications in cybersecurity. I delved into foundational concepts like data types, variables, and control structures, aligning them with cybersecurity contexts. I broadened my skills by exploring pre-built and user-defined functions, harnessing the power of modules for reusable code. Readability became a priority, where I employed pre-built functions, crafted my functions, and practiced module utilization to enhance code clarity.

My Python journey extended to strings and lists manipulation, with a focus on methods applicable to these data types. I utilized this knowledge to create algorithms and employed regular expressions for string pattern recognition. The application of Python to automate cybersecurity tasks, particularly those involving file operations, marked a significant milestone. I adeptly opened, read, and parsed files, culminating in structured content. The training concluded with strategies for effective code debugging, rounding out my practical Python capabilities. This extensive training equips me with a multifaceted skill set to automate tasks, manage files, and develop efficient and readable code in cybersecurity contexts.

Project Activity: Updating a file through a Python algorithm

<h4>Project Description:</h4> 

In my organisation, we regulate access to restricted content by implementing an allow list of IP addresses. The IP addresses are identified in the `"allow_list.txt"` file. A distinct list is used to identify IP addresses that should no longer be granted access to this content. I have developed an algorithm that automates the process of updating the `"allow_list.txt"` file by removing any IP addresses that should no longer have access. 

Open the file that contains the allow list

To begin the algorithm, I opened the file named `"allow_list.txt"`. First, I assigned the file name as a string to the variable `import_file`:

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/ce4f656a-0787-47a4-aa79-ea6def27f777)

Then, I used a with statement to open the file:

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/7d1efd48-ac60-48c9-a925-e979783adeaf)

The algorithm utilises the `with` statement in conjunction with the `.open()` function in read mode to open the allow list file for the explicit purpose of reading its contents. The objective of accessing the file is to enable the retrieval of the IP addresses stored within the allow list file. The utilisation of the `"with"` keyword facilitates resource management by automatically closing the file upon exiting the `"with"` statement. In the code snippet `with open(import_file, "r") as file:`, the `open()` function is utilised with two parameters. The initial step involves specifying the file to be imported, followed by indicating the desired action to be performed on the file. In this particular scenario, the letter `"r"` denotes my intention to engage in the act of reading. The code also utilises the `"as"` keyword to assign a variable named `"file"`. This variable is used to store the output of the `".open()"` function while operating within the `"with"` statement.

Read the file comment

To access the contents of the file, the `.read()` method was utilised to convert it into a string format.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/c0af937b-9ff1-4610-9e31-6a1a9e01ebfa)

When utilising the `.open()` function with the `"r"` argument, which stands for `"read,"` it is possible to invoke the `.read()` function within the body of the with statement. The `".read()"` method facilitates the conversion of the file into a string and enables the user to access its contents for reading purposes. I utilised the `.read()` method on the `file` variable specified within the with statement. Next, I assigned the string output of this method to the variable `"ip_addresses` 

To summarise, this code retrieves the contents of the `"allow_list.txt"` file and stores them as a string. This string can be utilised in my Python programme for data organisation and extraction purposes.

Convert the string to a list

To effectively exclude individual IP addresses from the allow list, it was necessary to convert it into a list format. Subsequently, I employed the `.split()` method to transform the `ip_addresses` string into a list.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/74afbb0e-eea5-423e-a68b-728d16b8a91a)

The `.split()` function is invoked by appending it to a string variable. The functionality involves the conversion of the string's contents into a list. The objective of dividing `ip_addresses` into a list is to facilitate the process of removing IP addresses from the allow list. The default behaviour of the `.split()` function is to divide the text into list elements based on whitespace. The algorithm utilises the `.split()` function to convert the data stored in the variable `ip_addresses`. This variable contains a string of IP addresses, each separated by a whitespace. The `.split()` function transforms this string into a list of IP addresses. In order to store this list, I have reassigned it to the variable `"ip_addresses"`. 

Itereate through the remove list 

One crucial aspect of my algorithm entails the process of iterating through the IP addresses that are elements within the `remove_list`. In order to accomplish this task, I have implemented a `for` loop.

![image](https://github.com/clintonsenaye/ClintonSenaye/assets/57267374/74781f52-7300-4473-a048-65bc36e57d12)

The `for` loop in Python iterates over a specified sequence, allowing code to be repeated. The primary objective of the `for` loop in a Python algorithm such as this is to execute specific code statements for each element within a sequence. The `"for"` keyword is used to initiate the execution of a `for` loop. The loop variable element is subsequently followed by the keyword `"in"`. The keyword `"in"` is used to iterate through the sequence `"ip_addresses"` and assign each value to the loop variable `"element"`. 

Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

The algorithm necessitates the removal of any IP address from the allow list, `ip_addresses`, that is also present in the `remove_list`.  As there were no duplicate entries in the `ip_addresses`, I utilised the following code to accomplish this task:

Within the for loop, a conditional was implemented to evaluate the presence of the loop variable `"element"` in the `"ip_addresses"` list. I performed this action to prevent any potential errors that may occur when applying the `.remove()` method to elements that are not present in the `ip_addresses` collection. 

Subsequently, I utilised the `.remove()` method on the `ip_addresses` within the specified conditional. I utilised the loop variable element as the argument in order to remove each IP address present in the `remove_list` from the `ip_addresses`.

Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses

As the concluding phase of my algorithm, it was necessary to modify the allow list file by incorporating the updated roster of IP addresses. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to convert the list back into a string. I utilised the `.join()` method to accomplish this task:

The `.join()` method is utilised to concatenate all elements within an iterable into a single string. The `.join()` method is utilised on a string that includes characters to serve as separators between the elements in the iterable when they are combined into a single string. In this algorithm, the `.join()` method was utilised to generate a string from the list `ip_addresses`. This string was subsequently passed as an argument to the `.write()` method for writing to the file `"allow_list.txt"`. I utilised the string `("n")` as the designated separator in Python to ensure that each element is placed on a separate line. 

Next, I utilised another `'with'` statement along with the `'.write()'` method to perform the file update.

For this instance, I utilised a supplementary argument of `"w"` when employing the `open()` function within my with statement. This statement suggests that there is a desire to access a file in order to overwrite its existing contents. When utilising the argument `"w"`, it is possible to invoke the `.write()` function within the body of the with statement. The `.write()` function is used to write string data to a designated file, effectively replacing any pre-existing content within the file. 

In this scenario, the objective is to write the updated allow list as a string to the file named `"allow_list.txt"`. By implementing this approach, the restricted content will effectively become inaccessible to any IP addresses that have been removed from the allow list. In order to modify the file, I utilised the`.write()` function and applied it to the file object named `"file"` that was previously identified within the with statement. I provided the `ip_addresses` variable as an argument to indicate that the data within the file specified in the with statement should be overwritten with the contents of this variable.

Summary 

I have developed an algorithm that effectively eliminates IP addresses, as specified in the `remove_list` variable, from the `"allow_list.txt"` file containing the list of authorised IP addresses. The algorithm entails the following steps: firstly, opening the file; secondly, converting the file into a string format for reading purposes; and finally, converting this string into a list, which will be stored in the variable `"ip_addresses"`. I proceeded to iterate through the IP addresses in the `remove_list`. During each iteration, I assessed whether the element was included in the `ip_addresses` list. I utilised the `.remove()` method to eliminate the element from the `ip_addresses`. Subsequently, the `.join()` method was utilised to convert the `ip_addresses` into a string format, facilitating the overwriting of the `"allow_list.txt"` file with the updated list of IP addresses.
